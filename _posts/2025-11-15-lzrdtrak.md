# Background

At some point in my life I got really obsessed with an idea of acquiring a lizard.

In effect, this specimen joined my household around spring last year:

Obviously, I could have just bought a pre built enclosure for her, with all the setup to control the conditions included - some even have mobile apps to help this purpose.

That would definetely be simpler, cheaper, faster, but I have immense amounts of audacity mixed with being really stingy and so I thought "If I do as much as possible myself, it would be cheaper".

Spoiler alert: it wasn't cheaper.

It also took forever, I gave up five times and still haven't finished the most important bits, but hey, at least...

no benefit of this really. Anyway, back to the project.

The idea was to build a system that will allow for the following:

- control turning on and off the lamps (UV, heating, basking), as well as fans for ventilation and (haha) home made dehumidifier if needed (not needed really, and put me back a couple of months because I tried learning fluid dynamics to simulate airflow in the enclosure) 
- the above devices should be turned on either based on time of the day (e.g. lights off at night) or output from temperature/humidity sensors (turn on if too cold, or too humid)
- get the piCamera image to be able to see the gecc when I'm not at home
- display the current state of a system in some sort of web interface available online for me and my friends to watch
