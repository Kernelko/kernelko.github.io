title: Setting up Vim and Latex to write quickly without other software
---

### Goal of the project

I wanted to create a lightweight setup where I can quickly write some text (I wanted to wrap up documentation for my gecko project). 

After a quick research I found this fantastic post: [inspiration link](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/#vim-and-latex)

The goal was to basically moreless replicate what was done there. 

### All The steps

#### Installation of Latex 

> sudo pacamna -S texlive-core

Potentially need to rebuild the format files

> sudo fmtutil-sys --all

#### Creation of directories

> mkdir GeckoBook

> cd GeckoBook

#### Sample document

> touch main.tex

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello
\end{document}
```

#### Installation of plugins

We need the folowing plugins:

- vim-plug

That's how you install it:

> curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim


```vim
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
Plug 'lervag/vimtex'
call plug#end()

let g:tex_flavor='latex'
let g:vimtex_view_method='general'
let g:vimtex_quickfix_mode=0
set conceallevel=1
let g:tex_conceal='abdmg'
```

> I tried with `zathura` but it didn't work so ended up using the default PDF viewing software which in my case is **Okular**

Now we can install the plugins:

> vim +PlugInstall +qall

#### Now should run the document

> vim main.tex

**Basic commands** to run vim this way:

- `\ll` compiles the document
- `\lv` views the pdf (opens the pdf editor)
- `\lc` cleans auxilliary files
- `\le` shows compilation errors
- `\lt` toggles table of contents

#### Setting up auto-compilation on vim file saving

I wanted to add this feature that when I press `ESC` and `:w` latex automatically recompiles my document and refreshes the pdf viewer

To do that, I added the following in `~/.vimrc`:

```vim
let g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk = {
    \ 'continuous' : 1,
\}
```

Now I need to run `\ll` only once and after it should recompile on each file save
